            Hello and welcome! My name is Sythong (see-tong) and I am passionate about making healthcare accessible to everyone. Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in anthropology while also exploring data science in my spare time. I enjoy reading, going on walks and hikes, photographing plants and insects, learning new things, and spending time with friends and family. My goal is to make a meaningful impact so if we can collaborate and make the world a better place, please connect with me on LinkedIn.
