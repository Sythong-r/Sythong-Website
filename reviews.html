            This book is a memoir of Chantha Nguon who takes her reader through her childhood, her experience during the Khmer Rouge genocide, her time as a refugee in Thailand, and her calling for a purpose in life all while recounting recipes associated with those experiences and emotions. Chantha and her husband, Dara Chan Kim created the Stung Treng Women’s Development Center to educate and help women lift themselves out of poverty.

            For those unfamiliar, the Khmer Rouge took place between 1975 and 1979 during political unrest in Cambodia. Khmer Rouge envisioned an agrarian utopia where the country would rebuild itself from year zero. Money and culture were abolished, and everyone was to become farmers and live as equals. In working towards their goal the Khmer Rouge killed an estimate of 1.2 to 2.8 million people, or 13 to 30 percent of the population. People were killed becuase of their identity or being overworked. Ethnic minority—espeicially the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Cham—and educated individuals were targeted. People were often considered or were accused of being an enemy of the regime; they were "re-educated" at prison camps and few made it out alive. Those who were not murdered for their status died from either starvation, disease, being overworked while at the labor camp, or while they fled—if they were not caught and executed. This is an oversimplified history. If you would like to learn more and prefer watching a video/documentary I would suggest the following:
        <ol>
            <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Killed_My_Father_(film) target="_blank">"First They Killed My Father" movie directed by Angelina Jolie.</a> It is based on a memoir, portraying the experience of the tragedy from a five-year-old girl's perspective.</li>
            <li>"Don't Think I've Forgotten" documentary directed by John Pirozzi. This explores Khmer Rouge through the lens of music. You can the documentary on Internet Archive (<a href=https://archive.org/details/DontThinkIveForgottenPOne00393113094mp4h264aacd target="_blank">part one</a> and <a href=https://archive.org/details/DontThinkIveForgottenPOne00dtihf393113095_mp4_h264_aac_hq target="_blank">part two</a>).</li>
            <li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEIYHTlbeLA target="_blank">"The magic of Khmer classical dance" Ted Talk by Prumsodun Ok.</a>This talk discusses Cambodian culture and how the genocide almost swept it all away.</li>
        </ol>

            This book gave me the perspective of a Vietnamese Cambodian (an ethnic minority) during the atrocious period of Cambodia's history. In fear of being targeted, Chantha's family returned to their homeland in Vietnam. But how could a child call a place she never grew up in home? And unfortunately, many people in Cambodia still hold negative views of ethnic Vietnamese.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although some negative views have dissolved, in my experience, a portion of people still hold those views. People believe that Vietnam, and the people of Vietnam, are trying to claim Cambodia's land. They often direct their anger towards ethnic Vietnam, perhaps because it is easier to get the attention and reaction of other civilians than trying to direct the grudge towards a nation-state. Those who hold negative views will tell the story of Koh Tral. Koh Tral was an island of Cambodia until 1939 when the Governor General of Indochina, Jules Brévié, set the boundaries between Cambodia and Vietnam. Koh Tral became a part of Vietnam and has been renamed Phú Quốc. Many nationalists dream of reclaiming the island. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Koh Tral is an example of a story that fuels hate. Another common anti-Vietnam rhetoric is the dissemination of public service announcements (PSAs) that Vietnam is trying to poison Cambodia through the various products and produce they export to Cambodia. A story I heard at my local bazaar was "Don't buy Vietnamese shoes, it's laced with poison that could kill the wearer over time."
        </p>
        <p>
            The anti-Vietnam sentiment is so ingrained that it has evolved into justification for discrimination. I want to take a moment to remind you that I am speaking from my experience and observation, others may disagree with my perspective. Further, I believe that the negative feelings associated with Vietnam is so deep that a political party has promised to kick all the yuon (the word they use) out of the country as part of their political campaign for many years. This party has garnered considerable of support from voters. Note that the word "yuon" refers to people from Vietnam and while some may argue it's not a bad term, it is often used in derogatory contexts. I am embarrassed to admit that I also hear this sentiment from my family. A family member was nicknamed "yuon" because they did not like sharing when they were younger. Needless to say, sharing is a social skill a child learns over time and they grew up to be kind and compassionate, the nickname was stuck with them until high school.

            With discussion of various food throughout the book, I started craving food from home: prahok (fermented fish), somlar kako (mixed veggie and greens soup), seasonal fruits, chrok (a term that could refer to relish, slaw, and pickled items), and the fish I caught from the rice paddy. The book brings me back to my roots, helping me connect with my elders by showing me what it was like to be in their shoes. My family doesn't speak much about the Khmer Rogue. The only person who talks about it is my grandma. And when she does, she usually talks about stealing food, painting it as an act of mischief. Or she would tell me about the songs she learned as a propaganda singer. My grandparents and parents have lived through the Khmer Rogue. I could only imagine how scared, angry, hungry, exhausted, hurt, and hopeless they must have felt. And the bittersweetness of stealing and sharing food because the ration wasn't enough to stop their stomach from rumbling at night. It's easy to see why my grandpa would yell at me if I didn't finish all the food on my plate as a kid. And even though my family isn't the most affectionate, they are showing love in the best way they know how. At times their idea of love is frustrating but I understand, to some extent, where it is coming from.

            I would recommend this book to anyone with a warning that this heavy book will pull your heartstrings in all directions. If you're Cambodian, I think this book offers a perspective of the war that could help you connect with and understand your family better. I would even encourage you to ask your elders about their childhood to learn more about them if you feel comfortable. Have you ever just thought that your parents and grandparents know (mostly) about your entire life, but you can't say the same about them? You know what I learned not too long ago? In her teenage years, my mom was picked on for inheritting monolid eyes from her half-Chinese father. That was the day I learned she has monolids. It's amazing how I haven't noticed that. Go connect with your family and learn more about them. For non-Cambodians, I think this provides a perspective of the Khmer Rogue period and knowledge of Cambodian cuisine, there are recipes in the book. This is not the most fun book, but it holds important history.
