<p>Hello this is my introduction page. You will learn a few things about me and my website.
The research tab features my current research and research interest. Reviews is where I discuss
books I've read and podcast I've listened to. And Personal blog is where I will take you on my
journey as a grad student at Syracuse University. Welcome to my mock webstie! :)
